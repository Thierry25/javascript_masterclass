/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. StoreMark'sandJohn'smassandheightinvariables
2. CalculateboththeirBMIsusingtheformula(youcanevenimplementboth
versions)
3. CreateaBooleanvariable'markHigherBMI'containinginformationabout
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

const markBMI = markWeight / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnWeight / johnHeight ** 2;
