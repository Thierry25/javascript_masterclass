// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on next page).
// In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
// 2. The first player in any player array is the goal keeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team1)used3substituteplayers.Socreatea new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
// 5. Basedonthegame.oddsobject,createonevariableforeachodd(called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
// 6. Writeafunction('printGoals')thatreceivesanarbitrarynumberofplayer names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
// 7. Theteamwiththeloweroddismorelikelytowin.Printtotheconsolewhich team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
// Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
